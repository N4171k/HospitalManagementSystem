# Patients Directory

The `Patients` directory is an essential part of the Hospital Management System (HMS). This directory stores the medical records and profiles of all the patients registered in the system.

## Directory Structure

Each patient has a unique file named after their full name (concatenation of first name and last name). For example, if a patient's name is John Doe, their file will be `JohnDoe.txt`.

## File Contents

Each patient's file contains detailed medical information, including personal details, medical observations, and prescribed medications. Below is a sample structure of what each file contains:
